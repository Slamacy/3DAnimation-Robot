# 3DAnimation-Robot
I made a robot character and a number of different animations for use in the Unreal Engine as part of my 3D Animation module. 

The animations made were:
- Duck
- Jump
- Run
- Idle

This was a solo project.

I used 3DS Max and Unreal Engine 4.

***Each animation file can be found under ..3DAnimation-Robot\3DSMaxProject\scenes***
